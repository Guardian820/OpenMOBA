Pathing between sectors:
- [x] Crossovers as portals between two sectors
- [x] Buffer sectors at crossover.
- [ ] Find segments between crossovers within a sector
- [ ] Find waypoints within sectors that can see crossovers


Two preprocessing passes in pathfinding:
For each sector:
  For each crossover pair, find min optimal pathing distance and max optimal pathing distance:
     (As in, lower/upper bound for optimal path cost between 2 points on crossovers).

Dijkstras over sectors as nodes, using max distance as edge cost. This finds the upper-bound on
path cost.

BFS over sectors as nodes, using min distance as edge cost in PQ, take while under upper-bound.

- [ ] Dijkstras starting at destination to upper-bound optimal path length
  - [ ] Per sector at out-crossover, take maximum distance
  - [ ] Start at next sector at crossover, zero distance of in-crossover
